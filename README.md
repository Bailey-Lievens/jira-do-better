This plugin only works on the JIRA installation of iO. The plugin has no access to anything but url's that match ```https://jira.hosted-tools.com/browse/*```.

## What it do üëÄ
A simple Chrome extension that makes the edit issue pop up larger. Because goddamn is it small and I like
to write large comments.

## Bugs üêû
- The Visual and Text button are outside their box, no idea why
- When clicking on Text the input field is smaller, I know why, but I can't be bothered to fix it because who uses that anyway

Honestly, I think that's all.

## Change requests üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
None will be taken and none will be fixed unless it bothers me

## FAQ
### Can I disable the plugin?
No idea how to make that so no, but you can uninstall it :))

### Is it vegan?
Yes! No animals were hurt in the process of making this and this plugin does not have any direct
consequence on animals.

### Why?
Because my comments are large and I always hated to use that small interface for editing my comments.

### Is this useful for me?
1. Do you work for iO?
2. Do you also write big comments?

If you answered yes to both, then yes.
